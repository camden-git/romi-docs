# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

In this chapter we will go over the basics of FRC terms and how to code your Romi. This chapter is recommended for people who do not already have knowledge in FRC terms and basic WpiLib programming.

Remember, this is all a skill, it's not going to come over night and is best learned through practice.

Good Luck!
