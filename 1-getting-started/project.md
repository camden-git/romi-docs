# Chapter 1 - Making the Project

## Prerequisites

Make sure your Romi is assembled and has charged batteries. You will also need a laptop running Windows, Mac, or Linux. You'll also need to have WPILib VSC 2022 installed ether [via the installer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) or the [VSC extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wpilibsuite.vscode-wpilib). If you want to prepare before lab you can install [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and download [the latest Romi firmware image](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/releases). Make sure to download [the correct file](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/_images/romi-download.webp). **Make sure you have a microSD card reader of some sort, there might not be enough in the lab**
