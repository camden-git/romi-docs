## First steps

- [Competition Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhMfsKyKgqH-K82wfswd5uddgTswYYFBDnPdiJt2Vuo/edit)

- [How to install WPILib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDTW3G4fEHTA7JEDTJQkzmKvFMO_lxTV0XU80y7wLt0/edit?usp=sharing)

  - This should be your first step--you need this to do any programming!

## Helpful (example) videos

- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5g4nHV3FaY) is a little long, but it explains the entire example project.

- [Programming with the Romi](https://youtu.be/pEDXmgfO6xM?t=2268)

  - This is a guide made by another FRC team--very useful example (although a bit hard to see the screen!).

## Software -- more advanced

- [4645’s Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WitrzoN6Q6B1IgMO45fV8jzwytaId9Z3TyBcCMq689U/edit)

- [Introduction to Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

  - Start here if you don’t understand what’s going on in the documentation/have no prior knowledge.

- [FRC Programming Done Right](https://frc-pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  - This is a great resource once you get a little more familiar/advanced with the Romi. It goes a lot more in depth than the FRC docs do.

### Further Movment Control

- [Driving straight](https://frc-pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control/driving_straight.html)
- [Gyros (turning)](https://frc-pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control/gyro.html)
- [PID control](https://frc-pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control/pid_control.html) *(this might be a bit to advanced currently)*
